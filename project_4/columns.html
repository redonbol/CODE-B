        <h1>JANUARY 1989</h1>
        <p>Prospect Cottage, its timbers black with pitch, stands on the shingle at Dungeness. Built eighty years ago at the sea’s edge – one stormy night many years ago waves roared up to the front door threatening to swallow it ... Now the sea has retreated leaving bands of shingle. You can see these clearly from the air; they fan out from the lighthouse at the tip of the Ness like contours on a map.</p>
        <p>April was brought in by a cruel cold that turned into a bitter easterly during the night. This tempest battered Prospect fearfully. I sat in a sleepless daze all the hours of darkness, fearing for every creaking timber, expecting the shrieking power lines to part. Each gust more violent than the last tightened the stomach. At 5:30 a pale premonition of dawn silhouetted the black clouds rushing up out of a boiling sea. Throughout the night the fishermen worked to secure their boats by the spectral headlights of their cars, which now and then turned landwards to light up this...</p></div>

        <h1>FEBRUARY 1989</h1>
        <p> Flowers spring up and entwine themselves like bindweed along the footpaths of my childhood. Most loved were the blue stars of wild forget-menots that shimmered in the dark Edwardian shrubberies of my grandmother’s garden. Pristine snowdrops spread out in the welcoming sun - a single crocus, purple among its golden companions. Wild columbine with its flowers shaped like vertebrae, and the ominous fritillaria that crouched snakelike in corners . . . </p>
        <p> A cuckoo echoes across the marshes. I took a long walk this evening and in the dying light discovered a patch of periwinkle deep in the wood. Lady’s smock was flowering by one of the old mine craters. I hadn’t noticed it before. The island of bracken is unfolding. May Day warm and overcast. Neither an indoor nor an outdoor day — strangely lethargic. My purple iris finally opened. Before turning in, I watered the garden, as I’m away for ten days and the forecast is for warm weather.</p></div>

        <h1>MARCH 1989</h1>
        <p>The roses, particularly the rugosas, which have broken bud, have been badly scorched by the continuous wind. An inventory of the garden shows me all else survives. The sea kale struggles on and the sea peas have germinated; so have a few self-sown nasturtiums and calendula. Parsley and poppies are thriving and the irises are a good nine inches high — quite startling in the shingle. The rabbits continually gnaw the fennel to the ground, but seem to leave everything else alone. The wallflowers, though, have been mauled by slugs.</p>
        <p> Took four lavender cuttings. Planted saxifrage. Try not to guess what lies in the future, but as fortune deals days enter them into your life’s book as windfalls. The rain has brought the garden to life; each morning the poppies bloom and scatter before midday. I pick the dried flower heads of the foxgloves and sprinkle the seed.</p></div>
